# Stone Packaging Resources

| Resource  | Description | 
|---|---|
|  __[Madara Prover API](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/madara-prover-api)__  | This project provides a server capable of executing any set of Cairo programs on top of the Starknet bootloader and generate the proof of execution of these programs. This server is used as part of the Madara sequencer to prove the transactions inside each (Madara) block  |
|  __[Stone Prover SDK](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/stone-prover-sdk)__ | Is a __Rust SDK__ for the Starkware Stone prover and verifier. To use this SDK, you will need the Stone prover and verifier binaries. You can either follow the instructions on the [Stone repository](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stone-prover), download them from the [latest SDK release.](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/stone-prover-sdk/releases/tag/v0.3.1)  |
| __[Stone CLI](https://github.com/zksecurity/stone-cli)__  | A __CLI__ for proving Cairo programs and verifying and serializing Cairo proofs.   |
|__[Stark EVM Adapter](https://github.com/zksecurity/stark-evm-adapter)__|stark-evm-adapter is a library that provides a set of utilities to parse and manipulate the output of the __STARK__ stone proof. Specifically, the library can be used to generate a "split proof", which is necessary for proofs to be verified on Ethereum.
|__[Integrity Calldata Generator](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/integrity-calldata-generator)__|This is a utility that helps generate integrity calldata, which keeps our data safe and reliable.  |
|__[Cairo Proof Parser](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/cairo-proof-parser)__ |This lib crate is a parser written to translate beetwen different cairo proof formats. The input to the parse function is a proof in a json string format. The proof is expected to be generated by the stone prover with the -generate_annotations flag. Currently only the recursive and starknet layouts are supported.
|__[Stark Book](https://zksecurity.github.io/stark-book/)__|This is the Starknet documentation where you can read and learn about it. If you want to delve deeper into Starknet you can check this [resource.](https://docs.starknet.io/)
